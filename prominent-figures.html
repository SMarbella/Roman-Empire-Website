          to Florus, Spartacus was a Thracian mercenary who worked as a Roman
          soldier, deserted his unit, and became enslaved as a gladiator. First,
          he convinced 70 gladiators to revolt against the Romans and escape to
          Mount Vesuvius. After two years, Spartacus and his men formed a
          rebellious army of 70,000 individuals. Alerted of the uprising, the
          Roman Senate killed Spartacus and his army.</p>

        <h2>Nero</h2>
        <p>Nero (37 AD - 68 AD) was one of Rome's most infamous emperors. His
          reign lasted from October 13, 54 until his suicide on June 9, 68. He
          reigned during the great fire that burnt two-thirds of Rome. According
          to modern legend, Noro played the fiddle while the fire continued
          burning. However, the fiddle was not invented around that time.
          According to eye-witness Tacitus, Nero was at Antium at the time of
          the fire. Tacitus stated that rumors of Nero wanting to burn Rome were
          never confirmed. There is no evidence of Nero starting the fire, but
          Nero compared the disaster to the destruction of Troy and blamed the
          Christians and Jews. The Roman Senate declared Nero a public enemy.
          While fleeing from the Roman Senate, Nero committed suicide on June 9,
          68 AD.</p>

          Trajan served as a soldier and possessed wisdom and dignity. Like
          Augustus, his ambitious military conquests gave Rome the
          second-greatest military expansion in Roman history. As Trajan

        <h2>Commodus</h2>
        <p>Commodus (161 AD - 192 AD) was one of Rome's most infamous emperors.
          He reigned from 180 AD until his assassination on December 31, 192 AD.
          Unlike his father, Marcus Aurelius, the Romans perceived Commodus an
          irresponsible man who failed his duties as an emperor. He undid most
          of his father's (Marcus Aurelius) accomplishments and could not live
          up to his father's standards. He lacked interest in government life.
          Commodus styled himself after Hercules and aspired to become a
          gladiator instead. He often dressed as Hercules with a club and lions
          skin. His lavish lifestyle in the arena drove the Roman Empire into
          bankruptcy. Unsatisfied with Commodus spending too much time as a
          gladiator and an incompetent emperor, the Roman Senate hired an
          athlete named Narcissus and successfully assassinated Commodus.</p>

          rulers in the third century AD. Constantine defeated all the possible
          emperors and united the divided lands in the Roman Kingdom. He was the
          first Christian Roman emperor and legalized Christianity, making
          Christianity the official religion of the empire. He later relocated
          the Roman capital of Rome to the east in Byzantium. Unsatisfied with
          the name of Byzantium, he renamed the new capital to Constantinopolis.
          He reigned from July 25, 306 AD until his peaceful death on May 22,
          337 AD.</p>
