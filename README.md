# Roman-Empire-Website

Submitted by: **Stephanie Marbella**

Time spent: **4** weeks spent in total

## Summary

**The Roman Empire** is a website and final project for LIS 475: User Interface and Website Design at the University of Arizona in Fall 2021. It gives visitors a quick introduction to the Roman Empire. Each page includes a quick summary of the Roman Empire's history, religious beliefs, citizens' social status, and prominent figures.

BlueGriffon gives me more flexibility in the formatting of my website than WordPress and Drupal because it allows me to edit CSS and HTML code, which provides more customizability when I develop websites. I used BlueGriffon to create this website from scratch and React.js to make my website compatible with both mobile devices and computers.

## Website Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:
- [x] HTML code used to build the blueprint of the website
- [x] Used HTML to give the website a title, pages, and bodies of texts

The following FUNCTIONALITY features are implemented:
- [x] Multiple pages in one website
- [x] An interactive menu that leads users to different pages

The following EXTRA features are implemented:
- [x] Added parallax scrolling to the large image near the header

## Notes

This website shows my creative and artistic side in web development. I demonstrated my artistic talent through the decorations used to make the website visually appealing. The borders, titles, and website design came from my imagination to help visitors feel immersed in the world of the ancient Roman Empire. While designing the art for the website, I wanted to preserve Roman aesthetics to enhance the look and feel of the Roman Empire.
