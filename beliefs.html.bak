        <p style="max-width: 983px;">Religion was very important to the Romans.
          The Romans were polytheists and worshipped many gods. Their gods and
          mythology were the same gods that the Ancient Greeks worshipped. The
          Romans gave their gods Latin names. Like the Ancient Greeks, the
          Romans believed that there was a god that represented each element and
          force found in nature and the observable world. There were gods and
          goddesses of sun, moon, seasons, planets, agriculture, animals,
          thunder, science, beauty, fertility, knowledge, war, music, and many
          more.</p>

        <p> To worship the gods, the Romans built temples and brought offerings
          inside the temples. They believed that leaving offerings to the gods
          and playing music was a sign of honor, veneration, and respect. They
          also held large feasts and celebrations at their pantheons.</p>

        <p> Before the first century A.D., Jesus Christ of Nazareth began the
          spread of Christianity to both the Jewish and Roman worlds. In the
          first century A.D., Christianity developed in Judea based on the
          teachings of Jesus and later on the teachings of Apostle Paul of
          Tarsus. Paul was an influential Roman citizen who spread Christianity
          throughout the Roman Empire. He wrote many letters that later became
          the New Testament of the Bible.</p>

        <p style="max-width: 983px;">At first, the Romans saw the Jews and early
          Christians as threats to the existence of their empire. They were
          hostile to Christianity and often blamed them for causing havoc
          throughout the empire. Thus, they believed that if they let
          Christianity take over the empire, the Roman Empire would collapse. In
          300 A.D., only ten percent of the Roman population practiced
          Christianity. By 400 A.D., the Roman Empire later converted to
          Christianity and declared it the official religion. When the Roman
          Empire split into the West and East Empires, it created the Catholic
          (west) and Orthodox (east) Christian branches.</p>
