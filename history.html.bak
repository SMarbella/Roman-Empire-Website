        <h1>Archaic Rome Under the Kings</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 983px;"></p>
        <p style="max-width: 983px;">The Roman Empire first began as a small,
          humble kingdom that co-existed with the Etruscans. It is unknown when
          Rome was founded. However, tradition declares April 21, 753 B.C. as
          the official date. In fourth century B.C., Roman scholar Marcus
          Terentius Varro set the exact date of Rome's founding in the first
          century B.C.</p>
        <p style="max-width: 983px;">Romulus and Remus had a grandfather, King
          Numitor, who ruled a kingdom located in the Alban Hills. The mythical
          city of Alba Longa was southeast of the plot of land that became Rome.
          According to legend, Amulius, the younger brother of Numitor, disposed
          the king and demanded Numitor's wife, Rhea, to drown her twins in the
          Tiber. Amulius did not want to deal with rival claimants to his
          throne. Twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, survived and became leaders
          of shepherd warriors.</p>
        <p style="max-width: 983px;">After Romulus and Remus learned about their
          true identity, they returned to Alba Longa and restored King Numitor
          to the throne. Romulus and Remus returned to the site where they were
          saved as infants and wanted to found a town. However, when the twins
          wanted to decide the name of the town, Romulus and Remus fought and
          quarreled. Romulus murdered Remus and named the town after himself.
          This small city of Rome was the beginning of the Roman civilization
          and future Roman Empire.</p>

        <h1>Roman Republic</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 983px;"></p>
        <p style="max-width: 983px;">In 509 B.C., the Romans expelled Etruscan
          kings and established their own government. They believed that one
          man, the king of Rome, was being too powerful. A Roman Republic
          government made sure that no one person became too powerful. They
          elected two consuls, which were rulers who had the same power as the
          king, each year who served one-year terms. According to Roman
          tradition, the year 509 B.C. marked the beginning of the Roman
          Republic.</p>

        <p style="max-width: 983px;">The Romans ruled as an empire for about 400
          years. Surprisingly, the Roman civilization was more stable as a
          smaller nation than a large empire. As a small nation, there was more
          stability, and when problems arose, the Roman government could easily
          fix the issues in nearby lands compared to distant lands in an empire.
          As an empire, the Roman government was more prone to corruption and
          instability, for news of instability from distant lands would come to
          the Roman government many months later.</p>
